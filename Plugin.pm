# HelloWorld tutorial plugin by Mitch Gerdisch
# Meant to be a way of figuring out and understanding how plugins need to be written for SC7.
# There are 4 basic components that need to be written for SC7 plugins:
#	Plugin.pm - This is the main processing bit of the plugin and not much different than pre-SC7 plugin code.
#				But, there are differences.
#	Settings.pm - This file contains perl code for processing the web page used to set the settings for the plugin.
#	strings.txt - Where all the strings are stored - including their various lanuage equivalents.
#	basic.html - This is a file under HTML/<language abbrev.>/plugins/<plugin name>/settings/. It contains
#				 HTML-like stuff for displaying the plugin's web user interface.

# This code is derived from code with the following copyright message:

# Plugin specific bit - put name of plugin where HelloWorld is.
# This points to the Settings.pm file that you also need to create/update for the plugin.

# Might be required. At least it's not bad to include it.

# Might be required. Not sure, but again it doesn't hurt.

# MUST HAVE: This log bit is new and allows one to use nicer logging facilities than were available pre-SC7
use Slim::Utils::Log;

# MUST HAVE: magical preferences getting stuff
use Slim::Utils::Prefs;

# MUST HAVE: provides the strings functionality that uses the strings.txt file to present the correct language
use Slim::Utils::Strings qw(string);

# So, get the data related to this plugin.
# The call to preferences() will be "plugin.<plugin name in lowercase>
# Something that might be interesting, there's actually a prefs file for each plugin.
# On Windows its stored in documents and settings/all users/application data/squeezecenter/prefs.
# You can look at it (it's a text file) and see what is being currently stored.
# However, there seems to be a lag between doing a set and it actually showing up in the file, fyi.

# So, squeezecenter.exe --debug plugin.helloworld=INFO,persist will show all messages fro INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL.
